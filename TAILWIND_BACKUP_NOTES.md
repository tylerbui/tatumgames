# Tailwind CSS Backup - Working Stax Design

## Current Status

✅ **WORKING**: Beautiful Stax-style landing page with inline CSS in `_app.tsx`

## Files to Restore

- **Main backup**: `/Users/tylerbui/tatum/apps/web/src/pages/_app.tsx.backup`
- **Current working**: `/Users/tylerbui/tatum/apps/web/src/pages/_app.tsx`

## What's Working

- ✅ Beautiful gradient backgrounds (blue to indigo)
- ✅ Professional header with navigation
- ✅ Styled buttons with hover effects
- ✅ Three feature cards with icons
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- ✅ All Tailwind classes converted to inline CSS
- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000

## The Problem We Solved

- Tailwind CSS wasn't loading through Next.js pipeline
- `globals.css` import wasn't being processed
- HTML had all classes but no styling applied

## The Solution

- Used `<style jsx global>` with manually written CSS
- Converted all Tailwind classes to regular CSS
- Added responsive breakpoints manually
- Included Inter font from Google Fonts

## To Restore Working State

```bash
cp /Users/tylerbui/tatum/apps/web/src/pages/_app.tsx.backup /Users/tylerbui/tatum/apps/web/src/pages/_app.tsx
```

## Next Steps for Tailwind Fix

1. Fix Tailwind CSS pipeline with Next.js
2. Ensure `globals.css` is properly processed
3. Remove inline styles and use proper Tailwind
4. Test that design still looks identical
